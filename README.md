==============

A collection of small python projects

This repository is simply a place for me to store small programs so that I can receive advice from more experienced programmers 
as to how I can improve my code!

***DESCRIPTION OF GAME OF LIFE***

Just download and run the program like you normally would run a python script. The simulation runs forever, until it reaches a steady
state or you close the application. It was built using tkinter and modifying the background colors of a grid of buttons
